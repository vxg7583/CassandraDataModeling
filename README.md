# CassandraDataModeling
This project involves creating an ETL pipeline and creating tables for three queries using Apache Cassandra. In Apache Cassandra, the data model is modeled depending on the query needs for fast data retrieval. This use case shows how a music startup like spotify can model data using NOSQL for their needs.
